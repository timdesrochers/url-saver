# Up next:
- Add prompt for tags to append to the timestamped log, maybe we can integrate the tagging in the future

# Down the line:
- Automagically pipe the URL to either archivebox, wayback, or whatever.
- Maybe add some logic to split youtube and vimeo links off into a separate pipeline for yt-dlp
- Futhermore: it would still be good to probably scrape the yt/vimeo video page itself for metadata, will need to research

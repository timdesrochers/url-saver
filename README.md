#URL Saver

Little loop that runs in your terminal, ready to record your input, one line at a time.

- wrote it on 2023-05-03
- it works on my machine
- for `fish` version 3.6.1
- writes to `~/saved-urls.txt` by default
- does not sanitize or validate input
- only checks that the last line of the outfile equals the most recent input line
- fuck Safari bookmarks sync, seriously
